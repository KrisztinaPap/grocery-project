## Introduction: 
- The Milestone 2 - React/Redux project is a React/Redux/Router application of your design. Convene with your group and plan a project that will challenge you and act as a future portfolio piece. Working through this project will demonstrate your knowledge and competency in: project planning, teamwork, HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript, git within a team context, React, React-Redux, and React-Router. There is a sample project description at the end of this document to give you ideas of what sort of application will meet the requirements

## Team Requirements:
- Please get in contact with your groups as soon as possible and decide on a group leader. The group leader will click on the GitHub classroom link and create a new team. All team members will then join the team created by the team leader.
- Create a “Team Name” to help identify yourselves!
- You must focus promptly on deciding what your project will be. Create a document detailing what features you are aiming to complete and a general description of what the project is. It is expected that a project summary be sent to TECHC@UAlberta.CA before the end of the week.

## Project Requirements:
- Demonstrates the use of Redux to manage global states
- Demonstrates the ability to get user input and process data before output
- Demonstrates the use of props
- Demonstrates the use of React Router to display multiple pages
- Code must pass validator tests (HTML, CSS, WCAG, if you are making custom content)

## Coding Criteria:
- Break down all functionality into reusable components
- Project must be error free
- Project must be warning free (the output when running ‘npm start’, from ESLint/Babel, must not contain warnings)
- Demonstrate use of project management skills (group meetings, use of Trello is required)
- Demonstrate concise and meaningful use of commenting
- Demonstrate concise and meaningful commit messages and active use of GitHub for version control as well as collaboration from multiple users
- Create a functionality document (intention of each page, explanation of features, think of it as a design and operating manual)
- Main GitHub page (ReadMe) should be set up with a proper project name, project banner, Trello link, and basic installation instructions (assume the user has no idea on how to run the application) Example: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
- Please include all wireframe, design, and planning documents in a folder within your GitHub Classroom repository

## Design Criteria:
- Demonstrates CARP design principles
- Demonstrates knowledge of color theory/correct colors are chosen
- No in-line styles
