Project Grocery
Summary
Our team decided to build a recipe and shopping list web application. There will be 3 pages (navigation links) visible to the user at all times: “home”, “shopping list”, and “about the team/project”. 
Breakdown by page
1. Home
When arriving on the “home” page, the user will have the option of logging in as an existing user, creating a new account, or continuing as a guest. If the user logs in, their name/avatar will show in the upper right corner.


Once logged in, the “home” page will be populated with recipes from an API. The user will be able to filter based on the food categories of the API. Clicking on an item will open the individual recipe view and the user will have the option to add the ingredients listed to their shopping list.
2. Shopping List
The shopping list page will display all the previously added ingredients in the order they were pushed. This feature will be limited to the current session due to the front-end-only nature of the application. The user will be able to remove any ingredients.
3. About the team/project
On the page, the user will be able to learn more about our team and the application itself. There will be instructions on how to use each page, citations/links for any resources we have utilized, etc.
